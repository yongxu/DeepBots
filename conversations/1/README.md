This conversation was the starting point of the rabbit hole.

I realized that DeekSeek R1, compared to other models, is brutally honest, and reason more like a human.

The conversation itself could be quite shocking, it exposed its own ideological shackles, and its answers are pretty politically interesting. 

So I just kept on digging the rabbit hole.
